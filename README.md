### BRAD6515
Breakout board for the Analog Device SSM6515 Ultra Low Power Class-D Audio Amplifier


## What is BRAD6515 ?
NiCE5340 SoM is the combination of the capabilities of two devices: a microcontroller and an FPGA. <br />
In this case, it is a Nordic **nRF5340** MCU and a Lattice **iCE40** FPGA. <br />
From the fusion of these two names comes the **NiCE5340**. <br />
